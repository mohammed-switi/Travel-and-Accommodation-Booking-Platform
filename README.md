# Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform

## üìã Project Description

A comprehensive backend API for a travel and accommodation booking platform built with ASP.NET Core. This system provides a complete solution for managing hotels, rooms, bookings, user authentication, and reviews. The platform supports multiple user roles including customers, hotel owners, and administrators, with features like real-time room availability, booking management, and user review systems.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and role-based authorization (Customer, Hotel Owner, Admin)
- **Hotel Management**: CRUD operations for hotels with amenities, images, and location data
- **Room Management**: Room types, pricing, availability tracking, and inventory management
- **Booking System**: Shopping cart functionality, booking creation, and status management
- **Review System**: Hotel reviews and ratings with validation ensuring only past guests can review
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced hotel search with filters for dates, location, price, amenities, and ratings
- **Recently Viewed**: Tracks user browsing history for personalized experience
- **Caching**: Redis integration for improved performance
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with Serilog and SQL Server sink

dotnet test

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --verbosity normal

# Run specific test project
dotnet test Tests/
```

### Testing Frameworks
- **xUnit**: Primary testing framework
- **Moq**: Mocking framework for unit tests
- **Entity Framework InMemory**: For integration tests

## üìä Logging and Monitoring

### Logging Configuration
The application uses **Serilog** for structured logging with the following sinks:
- **Console**: Development environment
- **SQL Server**: Production logging to database
- **File**: Rotating file logs in `/Logs` directory

### Log Levels
- **Information**: General application flow
- **Warning**: Unexpected situations that don't stop execution
- **Error**: Error events that might still allow application to continue
- **Critical**: Very serious error events

### Viewing Logs
Logs are stored in:
1. **Database**: `Logs` table in SQL Server
2. **Files**: `/Logs/log-YYYYMMDD.txt`
3. **Console**: During development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Payment Integration**: Mock payment system (no real payment processing)
- **Email Service**: Basic email functionality (needs SMTP configuration)
- **File Upload**: Limited to URL-based image management
- **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket integration for real-time booking updates

### Performance Considerations
- **Pagination**: Implemented for large datasets
- **Caching**: Redis caching for blacklist unvalid JWT tokens after logout or deleting a user 
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization needed for production

**Note**: This is an educational project demonstrating modern web API development practices with .NET Core. For production use, additional security hardening, performance optimization, and monitoring should be implemented.
